## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

npm install
```

TODO:
- figure out why the 3 album components on the right will re-render the 1st time i click either an arrow button or menu photo, & only the 1st time


- refactor assignFilters in generatePhotoInfo in seedHelpers.js to be more accurate to real life, e.g. follow actual categories/types of the photos rather than random?
- fill out trips for generatePhotoInfo based on actual trips user creates w/ UI
- refactor user contributions in generateUserInfo to count actual # of contributions per user?
- refactor Carousel & PhotoMenu into class components, move props/methods unique to those from App.jsx -> can't b/c methods use setState

- use S3, not unsplash -> it’s not about page load speed, it’s about viewing the hyperlinks since coming to a website and seeing the links going elsewhere makes it weird (ask Emily or Eric D. if need clarification)
